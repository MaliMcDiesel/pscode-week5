// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
	if remainder or number is 0,2,4,6,8
		then print EVEN
	if remainder or number ends in 1,3,5,7,9
		then print ODD

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum
sum / 5 = Quotient
print AVERAGE
(num1,num2,num3,num4,num5) = X
	if num <= x, then num = minimum
	if num >= x, then num = maximum
print <QUOTIENT> is the average
print <minimum> , <maximum> is the minimum and maximum

ask for 5 numbers
add numbers together
divide the sum by 5
print the quotient as the AVERAGE
